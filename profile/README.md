# Climate-Neutral Buildings

The [Climate-Neutral Buildings](https://www.isi.fraunhofer.de/en/competence-center/energietechnologien-energiesysteme/geschaeftsfelder/klimaneutrale_gebaeude.html) business unit at Fraunhofer ISI accelerates the transformation of the buildings sector to meet energy and climate targets. We focus on two pillars—boosting efficiency and decarbonizing heating and cooling—combining scientific rigor with real‑world solutions.

### What we do

- ⚙️ Technology‑, region‑, and actor‑specific modeling to explore pathways and future scenarios.
- 🔥 Socio‑technological and techno‑economic analyses to assess innovations for the heat transition and their viability.
- 🧭 Evidence‑based policy advice at EU and national levels, including the design and evaluation of policy instruments.

We work closely with policymakers, industry, and research partners to turn insights into measurable impact 🤝.
